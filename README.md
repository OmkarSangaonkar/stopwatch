# JavaScript Stopwatch

This is a simple JavaScript stopwatch that can be used to measure time intervals. It has start, stop, and reset functions, and it uses the setInterval function to increment the timer every 10 milliseconds.

## Usage

To use the stopwatch, include the JavaScript file in your HTML file and make sure you have HTML elements with the following ids:

"tens" for tens place
"seconds" for seconds place
"button-start" for start button
"button-stop" for stop button
"button-reset" for reset button
You can then start the stopwatch by clicking the start button, stop it by clicking the stop button, and reset it by clicking the reset button. The current time elapsed will be displayed in the tens and seconds place in the HTML.

## Customization

You can customize the stopwatch by modifying the JavaScript code, for example, you can change the interval time or the format of the timer display.
